Background
Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM) is a financial free zone, established pursuant to Federal Legislation
including Abu Dhabi Law No. 4 of 2013 (Founding Law) in the Emirate of Abu Dhabi. With its own civil
and commercial laws based on English common law, ADGM is an international financial centre that offers
the local, regional and international business community a world-class legal system and regulatory
regime.
The Registration Authority is the independent commercial regulatory authority in the ADGM, which has
the powers granted to it under the Founding Law. The Registration Authority’s responsibilities include the
incorporation of various corporate vehicles as well as the registration and commercial licensing of all
businesses operating in or from Al Maryah Island, Abu Dhabi. Its responsibilities also include all aspects
of the administration of ADGM’s commercial legislation, which can be found at this link:

Purpose of this Guidance Note
This guidance has been provided to assist potential registrants in relation to the Registrar’s requirements
in relation to the establishment of a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) in ADGM.
This guidance is issued under section 28 of the ADGM Commercial Licensing Regulations 2015. It applies
to all applications for incorporation and a commercial licence for an ADGM SPV, including applications
to grant an ADGM company a commercial license to conduct any of the following controlled activities:
1. 7012: Special purpose company for professional investors;
2. 7013: Special purpose company for professional investment institutions;
3. 7016: Activities of special purpose company; or
4. 7017: Activities of special purpose vehicle.
In particular, this guidance explains what the Registrar will look for in an application for a commercial
licence for an ADGM SPV when considering Rule 2 of the Commercial Licensing Regulations 2015
(Conditions of Licence and Branch Registration) Rules 2019, in particular, the requirement to provide
information showing (among other things):
“(c) the controlled activity or controlled activities which the applicant proposes to carry on in or
from the Abu Dhabi Global Market; and
… (g) such other information as the Registrar may require for the purpose of deciding whether to
grant a licence.” (together, Licensing Conditions Rule 2)
This guidance does not purport to cover all the requirements for the establishment of an ADGM SPV and
should be read in conjunction with all applicable Federal, Emirate and ADGM regulatory requirements,
including the application requirements prescribed under ADGM’s commercial licensing regulations and
rules. Where any inconsistency exists, the relevant legislative requirements will prevail.
ADGM’s Special Purpose Vehicle Regime
ADGM’s SPV Regime is designed to cater to a broad range of business types, uses and industry sectors.
These include corporates, financial institutions, sovereign wealth funds, family offices and individual
investors. ADGM SPVs are corporate vehicles, used for a variety of purposes, including to establish
subsidiaries, project or joint venture vehicles. The key feature of an SPV is its separate legal personality,
enabling the isolation of financial and legal risk from the assets and liabilities of the SPV’s shareholders
or any of its sister companies.
In ADGM, an SPV is incorporated either as:
 a Private Company Limited by Shares and licensed to conduct SPV activities; or
 a Restricted Scope Company (RSC), which allows for more limited disclosure on the public
register.1
The Nexus Requirement for ADGM SPVs
To satisfy the Registrar of the requirement at Licensing Conditions Rule 22 in relation to an ADGM SPV,
applicants must be able to demonstrate that the SPV will have an appropriate connection or ‘nexus’ to
the ADGM, the UAE and/or to the GCC Region (the Nexus Requirement).
A connection or ‘nexus’ may be demonstrated in a number of ways, including documentary evidence that:
1. The SPV is owned or controlled by a UAE or GCC based private company, family/family office
or individual;
2. The SPV holds assets that are located in the UAE or the GCC Region;
3. The SPV facilitates transactions connected, or provides real or economic benefit, to the UAE;
or
4. The SPV’s purpose includes the issuance of Securities that will be admitted to the Official List
maintained by the Financial Service Regulatory Authority (FSRA), and / or admitted to trading
on a Recognised Investment Exchange, MTF3, OTF4 or other licenced platform (including a
PFP5) that is established in ADGM.
For example, UAE sovereign and state-owned entities will have the requisite connection to the UAE and
would therefore satisfy the requirements of the Nexus Requirement.
Conversely, a SPV wholly owned by a foreign non-resident person that solely holds assets located
outside the UAE or the GCC Region would not meet the requirements of the Nexus Requirement.
Note: an SPV that is intended for a purpose that would otherwise have no connection to the UAE or GCC
region, would not meet the Nexus Requirement by appointing an ADGM (or UAE based) Company
Service Provider.
Registrar’s ultimate discretion
The Registrar recognises that not all circumstances or transactions are the same and will, at all times,
maintain the discretion to consider and decide each SPV application on a case-by-case basis. However,
the Registration Authority is unlikely to accept an application to incorporate an SPV if it does not satisfy
the Nexus Requirement.
Note: Pursuant to section 10 of the Commercial Licensing Regulations 2015, the decision to grant or
refuse an application for the grant of a commercial licence in ADGM is ultimately at the discretion of the
Registrar.
1 Subject to satisfying the eligibility criteria to apply for an RSC, as per the relevant sections of the ADGM
Companies Regulations 2015.
2 In addition to all the applicable licensing requirements prescribed in the ADGM commercial licensing regulations
and rules.
3 Multilateral Trading Facility.
4 Organised Trading Facility.
5 Private Financing Platform.
