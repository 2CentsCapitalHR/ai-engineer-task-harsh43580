ADGM Requirements
Beneficial ownership identification and verification is an essential component and integral part of
ADGM’s review process in registering a legal entity in ADGM. An applicant must provide such
information at the time of incorporation and this information must be kept up to date during the life
cycle of the legal entity.
In particular, each ADGM Person must keep a record of the required particulars of its beneficial
owners in a “record of beneficial owners”. ADGM Persons include ADGM incorporated companies
and limited liability partnerships (LLP), ADGM established foundations, and trustees of a trust
governed by the law of ADGM.
The relevant requirements and duties of an ADGM Person in maintaining a record of beneficial owners
can be found in the following Regulations:
• Beneficial Ownership and Control Regulations 2018;
• Beneficial Ownership and Control 2018 (Amendment No,1) Regulations 2019; and
• Beneficial Ownership and Control (Amendment No.1) Regulations 2020.
The Regulations can be found here https://en.adgm.thomsonreuters.com/rulebook/commercial-
legislation.

Note:
Where any of the above roles are fulfilled by a company, LLP or partnership, the ADGM Person shall identify
the natural persons who are the beneficial owners of such company, LLP or partnership, unless the company is
a listed company.
In any case, where a beneficial owner is:
• a listed company; or a company that is wholly-owned by the Federal Government of the United
Arab Emirates, or by any of the governments of the member Emirates of the United Arab
Emirates; or a company created by Emiri decree within the United Arab Emirates, it shall be
treated as a natural person for the purposes of the Regulations, and therefore (for the
avoidance of doubt) as the beneficial owner of the ADGM Person.
• “listed company” means a company listed on a stock exchange recognised by the Registrar
and subject to disclosure requirements which enable its beneficial owners to be identified.
• “Beneficial owner”, in relation to a partnership (other than an LLP), means any person who
ultimately is entitled to or controls (in each case whether directly or indirectly) 25% or more of
the share of the capital or profits of the partnership; or 25% or more of the voting rights in the
partnership; or hold the position of officer of the partnership.
How to determine the beneficial owner?
Test 1: The Ownership Test
The ownership test is to identify the individual who ultimately owns the ADGM Person. Ultimate
owners are considered to be a registrable beneficial owner and their information and identification
documents must be provided to the Registration Authority at the time of application and must be kept
up-to-date throughout the lifecycle of the ADGM Person.
To help you identify the registrable beneficial owners, please refer to the illustration below.
Registrable beneficial owners are identified through grey boxes.
Direct Ownership
In this example, Individual 1 owns 100% of the ADGM Entity. He is the beneficial owner.
In this example, Individual 1 and Individual 2 are direct owners of the ADGM Entity. Both individual are
the beneficial owners.
Indirect Ownership
In this example, Individual 1 is the indirect owner and beneficial owner of the ADGM Entity.
In this example, Individual 1 and Individual 2 are indirect owners and beneficial owners of the ADGM
Entity.
Multiple Indirect Ownership
In this example, there are multiple levels of indirect ownership. The two beneficial owners are clearly
marked in grey boxes. In this case, Individual 4 has a 32.75% interest in ADGM Entity (50% x 65.5% =
32.75%) and Individual 1 has 50%.
Calculating shareholdings: a reference in this Guidance Note to holding shares in an ADGM Person or
other legal entity is to holding a right to shares in the capital or, as the case may be, profits of that
person or other entity, and a reference to holding “25% or more of the shares” in that ADGM Person
or other legal entity is to holding a right or rights to share 25% or more of the capital or, as the case
may be, profits of that person or other entity.
If no registrable person can be identified under Test 1, Test 2 also needs to be considered.
Test 2: The Control Test
This test requires the identification of an individual or corporate entity that ultimately controls the
ADGM Entity by means other than ownership. For example, a person that holds 25% or more of the
voting rights of an ADGM Entity but the exercise of such voting rights is controlled by another. This
latter person is a beneficial owner in respect of the ADGM Entity. Nominee shareholding
arrangements are an example.
It is important to note that if, in relation to ADGM Entity, there are individuals who satisfy Test 2, in
addition to individual / corporate beneficial owners that satisfy Test 1, then all are registrable
beneficial owners in respect of that ADGM Entity.
Test 3: The Officer Test
This test only applies if no registrable owners have been identified under Test 1 or Test 2 and
stipulates that all natural persons who hold the position of officer of the ADGM Entity, will be
registrable as a beneficial owner.
