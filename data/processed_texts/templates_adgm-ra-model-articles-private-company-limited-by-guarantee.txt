PART 2
DIRECTORS
DIRECTORS’ POWERS AND RESPONSIBILITIES
Directors’ general authority
Subject to the articles, the directors are responsible for the management of the company’s business, for which purpose they may exercise all the powers of the company.
Members’ reserve power
(1) 	The members may, by special resolution, direct the directors to take, 	or refrain from taking, specified action.
(2) 	No such special resolution invalidates anything which the directors have done before the passing of the resolution.
Directors may delegate
(1) 	Subject to the articles, the directors may delegate any of the powers 	which are conferred on them under the articles—
to such person or committee,
by such means (including by power of attorney), 
to such an extent,
in relation to such matters or territories, and
on such terms and conditions,
as they think fit.
(2) 	If the directors so specify, any such delegation may authorise further delegation of the directors’ powers by any person to whom they are delegated.
(3) 	The directors may revoke any delegation in whole or part, or alter its terms and conditions.
Committees
(1) 	Committees to which the directors delegate any of their powers must 	follow procedures which are based as far as they are applicable on those 	provisions of the articles which govern the taking of decisions by 	directors.
(2) 	The directors may make rules of procedure for all or any committees, which prevail over rules derived from the articles if they are not consistent with them.
DECISION-MAKING BY DIRECTORS
Directors  to take decisions collectively
(1) 	The general rule about decision-making by directors is that any decision 	of the directors must be either a majority decision at a meeting or a 	decision taken in accordance with article 8.
(2)	If—
the company only has one director, and
no provision of the articles requires it to have more than one director,
the general rule does not apply, and the director may take decisions without regard to any of the provisions of the articles relating to directors’ decision-making.
Unanimous  decisions
(1) 	A decision of the directors is taken in accordance with this article 	when all eligible directors indicate to each other by any means that they 	share a common view on a matter.
(2) 	Such a decision may take the form of a resolution in writing, copies of which have been signed by each eligible director or to which each eligible director has otherwise indicated agreement in writing.
(3) 	References in this article to eligible directors are to directors who would have been entitled to vote on the matter had it been proposed as a resolution at a directors’ meeting.
(4) 	A decision may not be taken in accordance with this article if the eligible directors would not have formed a quorum at such a meeting.
Calling a directors’ meeting
(1) 	Any director  may call a  directors’ meeting by giving notice of the 	meeting to the directors or by authorising the company secretary (if any) 	to give such notice.
(2) 	Notice of any directors’ meeting must indicate— 
its proposed date and time,
where it is to take place, and
if it is anticipated that directors participating in the meeting will not be in the same place, how it is proposed that they should communicate with each other during the meeting.
(3) 	Notice of a directors’ meeting must be given to each director, but need not be in writing.
(4) 	Notice of a directors’ meeting need not be given to directors who waive their entitlement to notice of that meeting, by giving notice to that effect to the company not more than 7 days after the date on which the meeting is held. Where such notice is given after the meeting has been held, that does not affect the validity of the meeting, or of any business conducted at it.
Participation in directors’ meetings
(1) 	Subject  to  the  articles,  directors  participate  in  a  directors’  meeting,  	or  part  of  a directors’ meeting, when—
the meeting has been called and takes place in accordance with the articles, and
they can each communicate to the others any information or opinions they have on any particular item of the business of the meeting.
(2) 	In determining whether directors are participating in a directors’ meeting, it is irrelevant where any director is or how they communicate with each other.
(3) 	If all the directors participating in a meeting are not in the same place, they may decide that the meeting is to be treated as taking place wherever any of them is.
Quorum for directors’ meetings
(1) 	At a directors’ meeting, unless a quorum is participating, no proposal is 	to be voted on, except a proposal to call another meeting.
(2) 	The quorum for directors’ meetings may be fixed from time to time by a decision of the directors, but it must never be less than two, and unless otherwise fixed it is two.
(3) 	If the total number of directors for the time being is less than the quorum required, the directors must not take any decision other than a decision—
to appoint further directors, or
to call a general meeting so as to enable the members to appoint further directors.
Chairing of directors’ meetings
(1) 	The directors may appoint a director to chair their meetings.
(2) 	The person so appointed for the time being is known as the chairman. 
(3) 	The directors may terminate the chairman’s appointment at any time.
(4) 	If the chairman is not participating in a directors’ meeting within ten minutes of the time at which it was to start, the participating directors must appoint one of themselves to chair it.
Casting vote
(1)	 If the numbers of votes for and against a proposal are equal, the 	chairman or other director chairing the meeting has a casting vote.
(2) 	But this does not apply if, in accordance with the articles, the chairman or other director is not to be counted as participating in the decision-making process for quorum or voting purposes.
Conflicts of interest
(1) 	If  a  proposed  decision  of  the  directors  is  concerned  with  an  actual  	or  proposed transaction or arrangement with the company in which a 	director is interested, that director is not to be counted as participating in 	the decision-making process for quorum or voting purposes.
(2) 	But if paragraph (3) applies, a director who is interested in an actual or proposed transaction or arrangement with the company is to be counted as participating in the decision-making process for quorum and voting purposes.
(3) 	This paragraph applies when—
the company by ordinary resolution disapplies the provision of the articles which would otherwise prevent a director from being counted as participating in the decision-making process,
the director’s interest cannot reasonably be regarded as likely to give rise to a conflict of interest, or
the director’s conflict of interest arises from a permitted cause.
(4) 	For the purposes of this article, the following are permitted causes—
a guarantee given, or to be given, by or to a director in respect of an obligation incurred by or on behalf of the company or any of its subsidiaries,
subscription, or an agreement to subscribe, for securities of the company or any of its subsidiaries, or to underwrite, sub-underwrite, or guarantee subscription for any such securities, and
arrangements pursuant to which benefits are made available to employees and directors or former employees and directors of the company or any of its subsidiaries which do not provide special benefits for directors or former directors.
(5) 	For  the  purposes  of  this  article,  references  to  proposed  decisions  and  decision-making processes include any directors’ meeting or part of a directors’ meeting.
(6) 	Subject to paragraph (7), if a question arises at a meeting of directors or of a committee of directors as to the right of a director to participate in the meeting (or part of the meeting) for voting or quorum purposes, the question may, before the conclusion of the meeting, be referred to the chairman whose ruling in relation to any director other than the chairman is to be final and conclusive.
(7) 	If any question as to the right to participate in the meeting (or part of the meeting) should arise in respect of the chairman, the question is to be decided by a decision of the directors at that meeting, for which purpose the chairman is not to be counted as participating in the meeting (or that part of the meeting) for voting or quorum purposes.
Records of decisions to be kept
The directors must ensure that the company keeps a record, in writing, for at least 10 years from the date of the decision recorded, of every unanimous or majority decision taken by the directors.
Directors’ discretion to make further rules
Subject to the articles, the directors may make any rule which they think fit about how they take decisions, and about how such rules are to be recorded or communicated to directors.
APPOINTMENT OF DIRECTORS
Methods of appointing directors
(1) 	Any person who is willing to act as a director, and is permitted by law to 	do so, may be appointed to be a director—
by ordinary resolution, or
by a decision of the directors.
(2) 	In any case where, as a result of death, the company has no members and no directors, the personal representatives of the last member to have died have the right, by notice in writing, to appoint a person to be a director.
(3) 	For the purposes of paragraph (2), where 2 or more members die in circumstances rendering it uncertain who was the last to die, a younger member is deemed to have survived an older member.
Termination of director’s appointment
A person ceases to be a director as soon as—
that person ceases to be a director by virtue of any provision of the Companies Regulations or is prohibited from being a director by law,
that person becomes bankrupt,
a  composition  is  made  with  that  person’s  creditors  generally  in  satisfaction  of  that person’s debts,
a registered medical practitioner who is treating that person gives a written opinion to the company stating that that person has become physically or mentally incapable of acting as a director and may remain so for more than three months,
by reason of that person’s mental health, a court makes an order which wholly or partly prevents that person from personally exercising any powers or rights which that person would otherwise have,
notification is received by the company from the director that the director is resigning from office, and such resignation has taken effect in accordance with its terms.
Directors’ remuneration
(1) 	Directors may undertake any services for the company that the directors 	decide. 
(2)	Directors are entitled to such remuneration as the directors 	determine—
for their services to the company as directors, and
for any other service which they undertake for the company.
(3) 	Subject to the articles, a director’s remuneration may—
take any form, and
include any arrangements in connection with the payment of a pension, allowance or gratuity, or any death, sickness or disability benefits, to or in respect of that director.
(4) 	Unless the directors decide otherwise, directors’ remuneration accrues from day to day.
(5) 	Unless the directors decide otherwise, directors are not accountable to the company for any remuneration which they receive as directors or other officers or employees of the company’s subsidiaries or of any other body corporate in which the company is interested.
Directors’ expenses
The  company  may pay  any  reasonable  expenses  which  the  directors  properly  incur  in connection with their attendance at—
meetings of directors or committees of directors,

Poll votes
(1) 	A poll on a resolution may be demanded—
in advance of the general meeting where it is to be put to the vote, or
at a general meeting, either before a show of hands on that resolution or immediately after the result of a show of hands on that resolution is declared.
(2) 	A poll may be demanded by— 
the chairman of the meeting,

two or more persons having the right to vote on the resolution, or
a person or persons representing not less than one tenth of the total voting rights of all the members having the right to vote on the resolution.

Content of proxy notices
(1) 	Proxies may only validly be appointed by a notice in writing (a  	“proxy notice”)
which—
states the name and address of the member appointing the proxy,
identifies the person appointed to be that member’s proxy and the general meeting in relation to which that person is appointed,
is signed by or on behalf of the member appointing the proxy, or is authenticated in such manner as the directors may determine, and
is delivered to the company in accordance with the articles and any instructions contained in the notice of the general meeting to which they relate.
(2) 	The company may require proxy notices to be delivered in a particular form, and may specify different forms for different purposes.
(3) 	Proxy notices may specify how the proxy appointed under them is to vote (or that the proxy is to abstain from voting) on one or more resolutions.
(4) 	Unless a proxy notice indicates otherwise, it must be treated as—
allowing the person appointed under it as a proxy discretion as to how to vote on any ancillary or procedural resolutions put to the meeting, and
appointing that person as a proxy in relation to any adjournment of the general meeting to which it relates as well as the meeting itself.
Delivery of proxy notices
(1) 	A person who is entitled to attend, speak or vote (either on a show of 	hands or on a poll) at a general meeting remains so entitled in respect of 	that meeting or any adjournment of it, even though a valid proxy notice 	has been delivered to the company by or on behalf of that person.
(2) 	An appointment under a proxy notice may be revoked by delivering to the company a notice in writing given by or on behalf of the person by whom or on whose behalf the proxy notice was given.

notice of the proposed amendment is given to the company in writing by a person entitled to vote at the general meeting at which it is to be proposed not less than 48 hours before the meeting is to take place (or such later time as the chairman of the meeting may determine), and
the proposed amendment does not, in the reasonable opinion of the chairman of the meeting, materially alter the scope of the resolution.
(2) 	A special resolution to be proposed at a general meeting may be amended by ordinary resolution, if—
the chairman of the meeting proposes the amendment at the general meeting at which the resolution is to be proposed, and
the amendment does not go beyond what is necessary to correct a grammatical or other non-substantive error in the resolution.
(3) 	If the chairman of the meeting, acting in good faith, wrongly decides that an amendment to a resolution is out of order, the chairman’s error does not invalidate the vote on that resolution.
